# AuthVault Enterprise Edition

# 🔐🌈🌟AuthVault - The authorization App 🌈🌟🔐

## Introduction

Welcome to **AuthVault**! AuthVault is a robust web application crafted using the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. This dynamic site offers seamless authentication capabilities, allowing users to sign up, sign in securely, and sign out. It includes Google's OAuth functionality and delete user functionality. Access to protected routes is exclusively granted to authenticated users so that users can update their credentials such as profile picture, username, email, and password.
